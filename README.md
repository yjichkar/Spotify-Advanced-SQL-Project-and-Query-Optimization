## ðŸ“– Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Spotify dataset using **SQL**. It covers the entire process from exploring and normalizing a denormalized dataset to writing SQL queries of varying complexity and optimizing their performance. The primary objectives are:

- Gain hands-on experience with advanced SQL techniques.
- Explore and understand real-world data related to music tracks, albums, and artists.
- Perform query optimization to improve database efficiency.
- Generate meaningful insights for data-driven decision-making.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset Description
The dataset includes attributes such as:

- **Artist**: The performer of the track.
- **Track**: The name of the song.
- **Album**: The album where the track belongs.
- **Album Type**: Whether itâ€™s a single or album.
- **Metrics**: danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, and more.
- **Engagement**: Views, likes, comments, stream counts, etc.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

### âœ… Step 1 â€“ Data Exploration
- Review dataset attributes to understand track, album, and artist details.
- Explore metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, and streaming numbers.
- Identify patterns and relationships that could be insightful for analysis.

### âœ… Step 2 â€“ Data Preparation & Normalization
- Clean and structure the dataset.
- Normalize denormalized tables to optimize data integrity and querying.
- Insert data into the PostgreSQL database.

### âœ… Step 3 â€“ Writing SQL Queries
- **Easy Queries**: Retrieve data, filter rows, and perform basic aggregations.
- **Medium Queries**: Use grouping, joins, and aggregate functions for deeper analysis.
- **Advanced Queries**: Implement nested queries, window functions, CTEs, and advanced data transformations.

### âœ… Step 4 â€“ Query Optimization
- Analyze query performance using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Apply indexing on frequently used columns such as `artist`.
- Refactor queries for faster execution and lower planning time.
- Evaluate results to ensure optimized data retrieval.

### âœ… Step 5 â€“ Insights Generation
- Extract actionable insights from the data.
- Analyze user behavior and track popularity metrics.
- Apply best practices to improve data management and decision-making.
